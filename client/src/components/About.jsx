            <p>Hello! I`m Ernesto Serna, a passionate Full Stack developer with experience in creating innovative web solutions. My focus is on combining server-side development efficiency with client-side design elegance to deliver exceptional user experiences.

            Throughout my career, I`ve worked on a variety of projects ranging from enterprise applications to e-commerce platforms. My ability to work at all levels of development has given me a comprehensive view of projects, from conception to implementation.

            On the frontend, I excel in using technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, along with modern frameworks like React.js. My approach is always to create intuitive and engaging interfaces that enhance the user experience.

            On the backend, I`ve worked with technologies such as Node.js and Python, using frameworks like Express and Django to build robust and scalable services. Additionally, I have experience in designing efficient databases and implementing RESTful APIs.</p>
